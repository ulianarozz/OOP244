This workshop was a brand new challenge for me and seemed very different from the other workshops we did so far, 
at first I took a look at the main function to understand how the code works and only then did I start writing my code, 
I can never write my code without understanding the main function, after many mistakes of trial and error I finally managed to get the code running. 
In this workshop I learned how to manage and created classes and to get the access to private members through the public functions.
The main difficulty for me was to manage right the functions Get and Set, where I needed to change it from part1.
The other thing that I struggled a lot it was precision output (2) in one place without touching it in other parts on Display function.
I feel like my progress greatly increased since the start of the semester despite all the challenges of online school I seem to be pulling through very well in my opinion and I feel my progress happening on a weekly basis with every workshop I have to do research and find new perspectives for things we previously learned.
