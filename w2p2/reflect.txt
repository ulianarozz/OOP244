I learned some really interesting concepts in this workshop.
 First and foremost, the concept of allocation of dynamic memory for an array as well as a single variable was taken into practical use in this workshop, 
making us familiar with the concept. With allocation, I also learned deallocation of the dynamic memory of array,
 which is very crucial for avoiding a run time error.In this part I had most of my errors which I needed to solve. Allocation of dynamic memory along with user input was also learned in this workshop
. Overloading of a function, was also taught through this workshop.
 Passing variable by reference as a well readable alternative to passing value by address was also made familiar by this workshop. 
 Function with bool data type was also mentioned in the workshop, by which we understood that a value that is either true or false can be returned by it. 
Finally, we learned about memory issues like , memory leaks and insufficient memory.
