In this workshop I learnt how to use constructors and deconstructors and learnt how to manage them.
I also learnt how to overload the constructor several time for different needs. 
The hardest part for me in this workshop was "fight()" function that I needed to change from the part 1 to part 2 :
 to add more if conditions and powerup() function. 
It took me many hours to understand how to manage it. 
Also in the fight function we needed to remove const because the powerup of saiyans is permament now.
Another problem I faced this workshop was memory leak in the set function: the values should be null before we will call set function.
