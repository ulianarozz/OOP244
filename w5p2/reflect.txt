In this workshop I learnt how to use overloaded operators in c++ , the syntax that needs to be used ( operator symbols follows the keyword) 
and how to use them in our program to reduce typing. 
The hardest part for me was the second part where I needed to change the dynamic memory allocation in overloaded operator.
Only after my professor guided me where to study for it I was be able to fix it.
Also we learnt about declaring the constructor explicit to avoid  possibility of ambiguities in the conversion from one type to another cause by 
several sindle argument constructors.
